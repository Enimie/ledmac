%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v0.5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% There was a missing \else in \l@dcheckcols just before the
%%% error message. The symptom was reported by Tobias Verbeke.



%%% \startlock and \endlock did not work properly in the middle
%%% of a line. Problem reported by Stefano Cracolic
%%% Letting S stand for \startlock and E for \endlock and t for regular
%%% text, numbering is per the following examples:
%%%
%%%  1 Sttttt     1 Sttttt     1 Sttttt     1 Sttttt    
%%%    tttttt       tttttt       tttttt       tttttt    
%%%  2 ttEStt     2 ttttES       tttttE       tttttt    
%%%    tttttt       tttttt     2 Sttttt     2 EStttt    
%%%    tttttt       tttttt       tttttt       tttttt    
%%%    ttEttt       ttEttt       ttEttt       ttEttt    
%%%  3 tttttt     3 tttttt     3 tttttt     3 tttttt    
%%%  4 tttStt     4 tttttS     4 tttStt     4 ttSEtt    
%%%    tttttt       tttttt       tttttt     5 tttttt    
%%%    tttttt       tttttt       tttttt     6 tttttt    
%%%    ttEttt       Ettttt       tttttE     7 tttttt    
%%%  5 tttttt     5 tttttt     5 tttttt     8 tttttt    









%%% Reworked the sidenotes code.
%%% Sidenotes are normally aligned on their bottom lines,
%%% i.e, multiline notes extend upwards. To align notes on
%%% their top lines (multiline notes extend downwards):
%%% \rightnoteupfalse and/or \leftnoteupfalse. The default
%%% is, of course, \rightnoteuptrue and \leftnoteuptrue.














 





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v0.4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The instructions on page 26 in the manual regarding creating
%%% a new familiar footnote series are incorrect. Instead follow
%%% how the provided series are defined, that is, for example:
%%% \makeatletter
%%% \newcommand{\footnoteD}[1]{%
%%%   \stepcounter{footnoteD}%
%%%   \protected@xdef\@thefnmarkD{\thefootnoteD}%
%%%   \@footnotemarkD
%%%   \vfootnoteD{D}{#1}\m@mmf@prepare}
%%% 
%%% \newcounter{footnoteD} 
%%%   \renewcommand{\thefootnoteD}{\arabic{footnoteD}}
%%% \newinsert\footinsD
%%% 
%%% \newcommand{\mpfootnoteD}[1]{%
%%%   \stepcounter{footnoteD}%
%%%   \protected@xdef\@thefnmarkD{\thefootnoteD}%
%%%   \@footnotemarkD 
%%%   \mpvfootnoteD{D}{#1}\m@mmf@prepare}
%%% \newinsert\mpfootinsD
%%% 
%%% \footnormalX{D}
%%% \addfootinsX{D}
%%% \makeatother
%%% 

%%% Change \addfootinsX to correct screwups in defining new familar 
%%% series footnotes. Problem initially noted by Dirk Schlimm 
%%% (dschlimm@gmail.com) in private email, 2005/05/31






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% v0.3a %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Slight efficiency improvement (particularly for ledpar)
